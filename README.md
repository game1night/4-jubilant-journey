4 - a simple back-testing of Li's idea and try to explore style-based strategies

## jubilant-journey

### Intro

It's a bunch of function tools for back-testing. Such as getting the price tidy or ready for back-testing and finding the signals that indicated by the rules from your or other's idea. Also there will be a simple back-testing report for us to judge including return, profit, draw, p/md, sharp-ratio.

This project is ready for beginner's customize exploring, but it could not be the best choice cause there are many other software which is more easy and efficient. But it is quite convenient to make all the things done just by typing in Python. Thanks for the famous libraries especially for data science and visual processing.

Since this project is built under the [LICENSE](https://github.com/game1night/3-reader-plus/blob/master/LICENSE) of GPL 3.0 so you can share it under it. If any issue, let me know. Thanks. 

### Start

Run the function `run()` with default or customized parameters, or run the function `find_para()` with customized para_pools and creative variables.

### Rebuild

Where should we get started?  

- That's what `get_price()` done.

How to back-testing an idea? 

- That's what `update_record()` done. And:
  - `match_rule()`
  - `sim_trade()`
  - `calculate_trade()`

Which one is the best direction?

- That's what `find_para()` might tell us.
